                <h3>A Timeless Coffee Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    Brew & Bygone opened its doors in 1952, bringing the authentic taste of artisanal coffee to our
                    community. What started as a small family business has grown into a beloved institution, while still
                    maintaining our commitment to quality and tradition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our coffee beans are sourced from sustainable farms around the world, carefully selected and roasted
                    in-house to perfection. The recipes we use have been passed down through generations, ensuring that
                    every cup tells a story.
                </p>
